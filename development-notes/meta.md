jaqs
Angular CLI
- how to delete something from angular cli  (ie a mistaken conponent)
- FileReader(how do you have access to this type see ed component)
    - searched the project thinking that it's exposed by some angular component but it's not core
    - looks like it's in typescript module/package node module



## ISSUES

1. AUTH STUFF

* SIGNING IN AS ANOTHER USER
- THE FORMER USER STAYS PERSISTENT WHEN CONSTRUCTORS friendlyfire service for example is instantiated - it will show the value of former user.


* nothing anymore 1. uploadNewPic
